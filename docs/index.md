# AI Problem Framing for AI Practitioners

The hardest problems in AI aren't solved with better models or more data. They're solved by asking better questions.

Most AI practitioners learn to optimize models, engineer features, and deploy systems. But the most consequential decisions happen earlier: What problem are we actually solving? Is AI the right approach? Which of the dozen possible AI solutions should we pursue? How will we know if we're on the right track?

This course teaches you to frame AI problems before you build AI solutions. You'll learn systematic frameworks for deconstructing vague business goals into actionable AI opportunities, evaluating solution alternatives, and diagnosing when to persist, pivot, or stop. These skills separate practitioners who build technically impressive systems from those who deliver measurable business value.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- **Analyze** ambiguous business problems to identify viable AI opportunities and constraints
- **Evaluate** 13 distinct AI solution archetypes to match problems with appropriate approaches
- **Apply** The Loop framework to systematically deconstruct outcomes, explore alternatives, and assess trade-offs
- **Interpret** weak signals from user feedback, system metrics, and organizational dynamics to diagnose solution health
- **Decide** when to persist with current approaches, pivot to alternatives, or stop AI initiatives based on evidence
- **Synthesize** complete problem framing analyses for real-world case studies across multiple domains

These skills complement your technical expertise, enabling you to make strategic decisions about what to build before investing months in development.

## Course Structure

This course consists of six chapters designed to progressively build your problem framing capabilities:

### Chapter 1: The AI Problem Framing Mindset
Develop the foundational mindset shift from solution-first to problem-first thinking. Learn why most AI projects fail at the framing stage and how to approach problems with intellectual humility, outcome clarity, and constraint awareness.

### Chapter 2: AI Solution Alternatives
Master the 13 AI solution archetypes—from retrieval-augmented generation to reinforcement learning from human feedback. Understand when each archetype fits, their trade-offs, and how to avoid premature commitment to familiar solutions.

### Chapter 3: The Loop Framework
Learn the systematic Loop framework: Outcome → Deconstruction → Alternatives → Trade-offs → Signals. Apply this repeatable process to break down complex problems, generate diverse solutions, and establish success criteria before writing code.

### Chapter 4: Diagnosis - Reading Signals
Develop skills in reading weak and strong signals from user behavior, system performance, organizational dynamics, and external trends. Learn to distinguish meaningful feedback from noise and identify early warning signs of solution-problem mismatch.

### Chapter 5: Pivot - Acting on Signals
Make evidence-based decisions about when to persist, pivot, or stop. Learn structured approaches for evaluating pivot opportunities, managing sunk cost fallacies, and communicating strategic shifts to stakeholders.

### Chapter 6: Application - Full Case Studies
Synthesize your learning through complete case studies spanning healthcare, education, finance, and enterprise domains. Practice the full problem framing workflow from initial ambiguity to actionable implementation plans.

## Prerequisites

This is a graduate-level course designed for AI/ML practitioners with hands-on experience. Before starting, you should have:

- **Technical Foundation**: Working knowledge of machine learning fundamentals, including supervised learning, neural networks, and model evaluation metrics
- **Implementation Experience**: Experience building and deploying at least one AI/ML system in production or research settings
- **Programming Proficiency**: Comfort with Python and familiarity with standard ML libraries (scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, or similar)
- **Business Context**: Basic understanding of how AI systems operate within organizational contexts and deliver business value

This course assumes you can build AI solutions and focuses on helping you decide what to build. If you need to strengthen your technical foundations first, consider completing introductory ML coursework before enrolling.

## How to Use This Course

### Navigation
This course is designed for self-paced learning over approximately 40 hours. Each chapter includes:

- **Conceptual frameworks** with real-world examples and failure case studies
- **Interactive exercises** to practice applying frameworks to scenarios
- **Self-assessment questions** to check your understanding before moving forward
- **Portfolio assignments** that build toward your final case study analysis

Use the navigation sidebar to move between chapters. We recommend progressing sequentially, as later chapters build on frameworks introduced earlier.

### Portfolio Requirements
Assessment is portfolio-based rather than exam-based. Throughout the course, you will:

1. Complete **framework application exercises** demonstrating your ability to use The Loop, evaluate alternatives, and read signals
2. Submit **written analyses** of case studies showing systematic problem deconstruction
3. Develop a **capstone case study** where you apply the full problem framing workflow to a real or realistic AI opportunity

Peer feedback is encouraged but not required. You can work independently or form study groups to critique each other's problem framings.

### Self-Assessment
Each chapter includes self-assessment questions to gauge your readiness to progress. These are designed for reflection, not grading. If you struggle with assessment questions, review the chapter concepts before moving forward.

### Getting Help
This course emphasizes independent critical thinking, but you're not alone:

- Use the **discussion forums** to ask clarifying questions or debate alternative framings
- Consult the **additional resources** linked in each chapter for deeper dives
- Review **annotated examples** showing expert problem framing for similar cases

## Ready to Begin?

Start with [Chapter 1: The AI Problem Framing Mindset](chapters/01-mindset/index.md) to develop the foundational thinking patterns that enable effective problem framing.

Remember: The goal isn't to become skeptical of AI solutions. It's to become systematic about matching solutions to problems, recognizing when you're on the wrong track, and making strategic pivots before wasting months of effort.

The best AI practitioners don't just build things right. They build the right things.
