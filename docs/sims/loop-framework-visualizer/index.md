# LOOP Framework Visualizer

Master systematic problem framing by walking through the five-stage LOOP framework with interactive guidance and visual feedback.

## How to Use This MicroSim

### Getting Started
1. **Enter your problem statement** in the text area (or select a sample problem)
2. **Progress through each step** sequentially—each stage builds on the previous
3. **Complete all required inputs** before advancing to the next stage
4. **Toggle to Canvas View** at any time to see the big picture
5. **Export your framework** when complete for documentation or presentation

### The Five Stages

**Step 1: Outcome**
Define what success looks like. Be specific about whose outcome matters (user, business, or technical) and what measurable state you're optimizing for.

**Step 2: Deconstruction**
Break the problem into key components. Assign priority levels to focus your analysis. The visualization shows how components relate to your outcome.

**Step 3: Alternatives**
Generate multiple solution approaches. Tag each as AI, non-AI, or hybrid. The visualization helps you see the solution landscape.

**Step 4: Trade-offs**
Position alternatives on two axes (e.g., Cost vs. Accuracy). Drag points to reflect realistic trade-offs. The Pareto frontier highlights optimal solutions.

**Step 5: Signals**
Define success metrics (green light), kill criteria (red light), and leading indicators (yellow light). Set thresholds for decision-making.

### Tips for Effective Use
- **Start broad, then narrow:** Your first pass can be rough—refine as you progress
- **Revisit earlier steps:** If Step 4 reveals issues, go back and adjust components
- **Use the Canvas View:** This holistic perspective often reveals gaps or conflicts
- **Save frequently:** The MicroSim auto-saves, but export JSON for version control
- **Compare approaches:** Try framing the same problem multiple ways

## Learning Objectives

By completing this MicroSim, you will:

1. **Apply** the LOOP framework to authentic problem scenarios
2. **Analyze** how problem components, alternatives, and trade-offs interconnect
3. **Evaluate** the completeness and coherence of your problem framing
4. **Create** a comprehensive problem canvas suitable for stakeholder communication
5. **Recognize** when iteration is needed based on emerging insights

## Connection to Course Content

- **Chapter 1:** Introduction to LOOP framework fundamentals
- **Chapter 2:** Deep dive into alternatives and AI vs. non-AI solutions
- **Chapter 3:** Trade-off analysis and decision matrices
- **Chapter 4:** Signal design and success metrics
- **Chapter 5:** Iterative problem framing and pivoting

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Vague outcomes:** "Improve user experience" is too broad—specify what aspect and how much
- **Too few alternatives:** Generate at least 3-5 to reveal meaningful trade-offs
- **Ignoring non-AI options:** Always consider if AI is truly necessary
- **Unrealistic trade-off positions:** Be honest about constraints—no solution is perfect
- **Signals without thresholds:** Quantify what "success" or "failure" actually means

## Assessment Applications

This MicroSim directly supports:
- **Homework Assignment 2:** LOOP Framework Application
- **Midterm Case Study:** Problem framing under time constraints
- **Final Project:** Comprehensive problem canvas for capstone work
- **Peer Review Exercise:** Critique classmates' frameworks using this structure
