# Teaching Philosophy

## The AI-First Learning Problem

In an AI-first world, information is cheap and traditional quality signals are noisy. Grades, degrees, and written work can be automated. My teaching philosophy focuses on creating **quality signals that cannot be automated** by building real things, launching publicly, and iterating with real feedback.

## The Build → Present → Feedback → Iterate Loop

Learning happens through a cycle that introduces meaningful friction:

1. **Intrinsic motivation**: start with a real problem the learner cares about
2. **Build**: create a working MVP
3. **Present**: launch publicly (a real URL, not screenshots)
4. **Feedback**: gather input from peers and real users
5. **Iterate**: improve visibly across versions

This loop replaces grades with public deployment and iteration as the quality signal.

## Low Floor, High Ceiling

Every course component should be accessible to beginners while offering unlimited depth for advanced learners.

- **Low floor**: no-code tools, scaffolded frameworks, worked examples, and MicroSims
- **High ceiling**: real deployment, versioned iteration, advanced contributions, and capstone impact

## Intrinsic Motivation Over Assigned Topics

Students learn deeper when they solve problems they personally feel. Instead of assigning topics, I help students discover authentic pain through questions about frequency, severity, personal connection, and current workarounds.

## Coaching, Not Lecturing

The instructor's role shifts from content delivery to Socratic coaching. I focus on clarifying, challenging, and assumption-testing questions. The core stance is:

> You're not building a product yet — you're testing assumptions.

## Evidence-Based Learning Design

All course content aligns with four research-backed pillars:

1. **Clear, purposeful structure**: small segments, sequencing, and strong signaling
2. **Active learning**: concrete examples, MicroSims, and narrative coherence
3. **Continuous practice and feedback**: low-stakes exercises, peer review, and reflection
4. **Simple UX**: intuitive navigation, mobile-first, and minimal cognitive load

## The Intelligent Textbook Framework

Courses are designed as Level 2-3 intelligent textbooks with:

- **Learning graphs** (concept dependencies)
- **MicroSims** (interactive exploration)
- **Glossaries, quizzes, and FAQs** aligned to learning objectives

## Capability Architecture Over Tool Usage

I prioritize durable capabilities over tool-specific training:

- **Context engineering**
- **System orchestration**
- **Business coherence and assumption testing**

The goal is to develop judgment, agency, and the ability to create under uncertainty.
