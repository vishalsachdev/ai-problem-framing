## Questions

### Question 1 (Remember)
**What are the five sequential steps of The Loop?**

A) Identify → Measure → Analyze → Decide → Execute
B) Frame → Ideate → Build → Test → Learn
C) Define Problem → Set Metrics → Gather Data → Adjust → Repeat
D) Understand → Strategize → Implement → Monitor → Refine

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:** The Loop's five steps, executed in strict sequence, are: (1) Identify the problem, (2) Measure the outcome, (3) Analyze the data, (4) Decide on adjustments, and (5) Execute changes. This cyclical process ensures continuous improvement based on empirical feedback.

### Question 2 (Remember)
**Which signal type indicates that the project should be halted immediately?**

A) Leading indicator
B) Success signal
C) Kill signal
D) Outcome metric

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:** A kill signal is a predetermined threshold or condition that, when triggered, signals immediate project termination. Unlike success signals (which indicate progress) or leading indicators (which predict future outcomes), kill signals protect resources by stopping underperforming initiatives.

### Question 3 (Understand)
**What makes a good outcome metric for use in The Loop?**

A) It measures inputs and efforts invested in the solution
B) It directly measures the end result users care about, is quantifiable, and can be tracked regularly
C) It focuses on process compliance and adherence to procedures
D) It combines multiple unrelated measurements into a single score

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** A good outcome metric measures what actually matters to users (not effort or process), is quantifiable so you can compare before/after, and can be tracked regularly to inform Loop iterations. Vanity metrics or activity metrics fail this standard.

---

### Question 4 (Understand)
**How do "atomic units" relate to problem deconstruction?**

A) They are large, comprehensive problems that cannot be broken down further
B) They are the smallest meaningful pieces a problem can be divided into while remaining solvable
C) They represent the total cost of solving an entire problem
D) They are theoretical units used only in academic frameworks

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Atomic units are the smallest, irreducible components that problems can be decomposed into. They are meaningful enough to solve independently and test, yet small enough to iterate on quickly. Identifying atomic units enables parallel work and faster learning.

---

### Question 5 (Understand)
**What is the primary purpose of documenting assumptions in The Loop?**

A) To assign blame if the solution fails
B) To identify which beliefs underpin your strategy so they can be tested empirically
C) To exclude stakeholders who disagree with the plan
D) To create legal documentation for compliance

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Assumptions are the unspoken beliefs driving your approach. By explicitly documenting them, you can test each one during Loop iterations. This turns hidden risks (assumptions you didn't know you were making) into testable hypotheses, improving decision-making.

### Question 6 (Apply)
**You're building an AI tutoring assistant and want to measure success. Your outcome metric is "daily active users." Why might this be problematic, and what would be a better metric?**

A) Daily active users is problematic because it measures input, not outcome. A better metric would be "improvement in student test scores" or "student confidence levels"
B) Daily active users is problematic because it's too easy to achieve. A better metric would be "revenue per user"
C) Daily active users is problematic because it doesn't measure AI quality. A better metric would be "number of features shipped"
D) Daily active users is problematic because it requires daily tracking. A better metric would be "monthly active users"

**Answer:** A

**Explanation:** Daily active users measures engagement (an input) rather than the actual outcome—whether students are learning better. Outcome metrics for educational AI should focus on learning gains, skill improvement, or student confidence, which directly measure whether the tool achieves its intended purpose.

### Question 7 (Apply)
**A startup is using The Loop to improve their product's conversion rate. They identify three atomic units: (1) Simplify checkout, (2) Add trust signals, (3) Optimize email reminders. They can only pursue two simultaneously. Using the Loop framework, how should they prioritize?**

A) Choose the two that sound most innovative
B) Choose the two with the highest assumed impact and lowest implementation cost; test both in parallel with clear outcome metrics for each
C) Start with all three sequentially; this is the safest approach
D) Choose based on which the CEO prefers

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The Loop emphasizes parallel testing of high-impact, low-effort experiments. With limited capacity, prioritize atomic units by impact × feasibility, then run them with independent metrics to isolate what actually drives conversion. This accelerates learning compared to sequential testing.

### Question 8 (Apply)
**You're designing an AI content moderation system. Your success signal is "zero harmful content gets published." Your kill signal is "we block more than 10% of legitimate content." What does this tell us about your alternatives menu?**

A) The alternatives menu is irrelevant to signal design
B) The success and kill signals reveal tension between competing outcomes, suggesting your alternatives menu should explore trade-off points between safety and usability
C) The signals are contradictory and the project should be abandoned
D) You need only a success signal; kill signals are redundant

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Success and kill signals that create opposing tensions (zero harmful vs. <10% false positives) reveal inherent trade-offs. This signals that your alternatives menu should explore different moderation strategies with different trade-off profiles: stricter moderation (fewer false negatives, more false positives) vs. looser approaches, different AI thresholds, human review queues, etc.

---

### Question 9 (Analyze)
**A team conducts a Loop iteration and discovers their leading indicator (user session duration) improved 20%, but the success signal (account upgrade rate) declined 15%. What should they conclude?**

A) The leading indicator is broken; ignore it and focus only on success signals
B) The iteration failed completely and should be abandoned
C) Their leading indicator may be misaligned with true user value; they should investigate what's driving session duration vs. upgrade decisions
D) Success signals always trump leading indicators; optimize purely for upgrades

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:** Misalignment between leading and success signals is a valuable diagnostic. It suggests the leading indicator doesn't predict the outcome you actually care about. This is not failure—it's a discovery that lets you recalibrate. Investigate: Are users spending more time but getting frustrated? Is the upgraded feature not addressing their core need? This shapes the next Loop iteration.

---

### Question 10 (Analyze)
**You're at the end of a Loop cycle. Your data shows the problem is more nuanced than originally framed: what you thought was a single atomic unit actually has three interdependent sub-components. How should you respond in the next Loop cycle?**

A) Give up; the problem is too complex for The Loop
B) Revise your problem deconstruction; return to The Loop's first step with a refined atomic unit breakdown that accounts for these dependencies
C) Ignore the finding and continue with the original plan
D) Hire more engineers to force the original solution through

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** This is The Loop working as intended. Empirical data revealing that your problem decomposition was incomplete is not failure—it's learning that feeds directly into the next iteration. Return to framing with better understanding. This refinement cycle (where atomic units may themselves decompose further) is central to the framework's power.
