#### 1. What is System 2 Thinking?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Automatic, fast, and intuitive mental processing that requires minimal effort
2. Deliberate, slow, and logical mental processing that requires conscious effort and attention
3. The second stage of problem-solving that occurs after initial observations
4. A cognitive bias that causes us to rely on familiar solutions
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    System 2 Thinking refers to the deliberate, slow, and analytical mode of cognition that requires conscious mental effort. This type of thinking is essential for problem framing because it allows us to carefully examine assumptions, consider multiple perspectives, and think critically about complex problems rather than relying on automatic responses.

    **Concept:** System 2 Thinking

#### 2. Define Hammer Bias.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The tendency to over-complicate problems by using advanced tools unnecessarily
2. The cognitive tendency to view most problems as nails because you have a hammer
3. The bias against using familiar tools even when they are the best solution
4. The preference for physical solutions over algorithmic ones
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    Hammer Bias (also known as the law of the instrument) describes the tendency to rely on a familiar tool or solution when it may not be the most appropriate for the problem at hand. In AI problem framing, this bias can lead us to apply AI solutions to problems that don't actually require AI, simply because AI is the tool we know well.

    **Concept:** Hammer Bias

#### 3. Which describes the purpose of the Stranger Test?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. To evaluate whether a proposed AI solution would work for unfamiliar domains
2. To determine if your problem framing makes sense to someone unfamiliar with your domain
3. To test whether an AI model can understand concepts from foreign cultures
4. To assess if a solution is too simple to be valuable
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    The Stranger Test is a problem framing technique where you explain your problem and proposed solution to someone unfamiliar with your domain. If they can't understand the framing or it doesn't make sense to them, it may indicate unclear thinking or hidden assumptions. This helps reveal whether your problem definition is truly clear or merely sounds clear because of domain familiarity.

    **Concept:** Stranger Test

---

#### 4. What is Domain Context in problem framing?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The specific background knowledge, constraints, and norms within a particular field or industry
2. A visual diagram showing the scope of a problem
3. The list of stakeholders involved in implementing a solution
4. The temporal boundaries that define when a problem becomes relevant
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**.

    Domain Context encompasses the specific knowledge, rules, constraints, and conventions that exist within a particular field or industry. Understanding domain context is critical for effective problem framing because it helps you recognize what's truly novel about your problem versus what's already known within that domain, and it prevents you from applying inappropriate solutions based on misunderstandings of how things actually work.

    **Concept:** Domain Context

---

#### 5. Explain why Reframing is important when approaching AI problems.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Because the first way you frame a problem is rarely the most effective or accurate perspective
2. Because it confuses competitors and keeps your approach secret
3. Because problems must be stated at least twice to satisfy stakeholder requirements
4. Because reframing allows you to avoid difficult technical challenges
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**.

    Reframing—the process of viewing a problem from different angles and perspectives—is crucial because our initial problem framing often reflects our biases, assumptions, and limited viewpoint. By reframing, we can uncover hidden assumptions, discover root causes rather than symptoms, and find more elegant or appropriate solutions. Multiple frames often reveal insights that a single perspective would miss.

    **Concept:** Reframing

#### 6. What is the relationship between Cognitive Bias and problem framing?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Cognitive biases are irrelevant to problem framing since framing is a rational process
2. Cognitive biases can systematically distort how we perceive and frame problems, leading to flawed problem definitions
3. Problem framing is the process of identifying and eliminating all human bias
4. Cognitive biases make problem framing easier by providing quick mental shortcuts
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    Cognitive biases are systematic patterns in how our minds process information, and they inevitably influence how we perceive, define, and frame problems. Recognizing this relationship is essential—we must acknowledge that our initial problem framing is filtered through various biases (confirmation bias, availability bias, etc.). Awareness of cognitive biases is the first step toward mitigating their impact on problem framing.

    **Concept:** Cognitive Bias

#### 7. Given this scenario: A company sees employees struggling with information discovery and immediately proposes building an AI chatbot. What problem framing issue is most likely occurring?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The team has successfully applied First Principles thinking to identify the root cause
2. The team is exhibiting Hammer Bias by proposing an AI solution without fully understanding the underlying problem
3. The team has properly used the Stranger Test to validate their approach
4. The team is correctly applying Domain Context to the information discovery challenge
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    This scenario exemplifies Hammer Bias—the tendency to reach for a familiar tool (AI/chatbot) without first deeply understanding whether that's actually the right solution. Before jumping to an AI chatbot, the team should investigate: Is the problem truly a lack of AI-powered search, or is it poor information organization, unclear documentation, or inadequate training? An AI chatbot might address symptoms without solving the actual root problem.

    **Concept:** Hammer Bias

#### 8. How would you apply First Principles thinking to challenge an assumption in your problem framing?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Accept the assumption if it's widely believed in your industry
2. Break down the problem into fundamental truths and rebuild your understanding from scratch
3. Ask five "why" questions and accept the fifth answer as the root cause
4. Apply statistical analysis to determine if the assumption is mathematically valid
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    First Principles thinking involves deconstructing a problem to its fundamental truths rather than relying on assumptions or analogies. When challenging an assumption in problem framing, you should strip away conventional wisdom, examine what you truly know versus what you assume, and rebuild your understanding from the ground up. This approach often reveals that assumed constraints aren't actually constraints, or that your problem definition relies on questionable premises.

    **Concept:** First Principles

#### 9. Compare Mental Models and Domain Context as tools for problem framing.

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Mental Models are universal; Domain Context varies by field; both are equally important for framing
2. Mental Models are internal cognitive frameworks for understanding systems; Domain Context is the external knowledge specific to a field; both inform but serve different roles
3. Domain Context replaces the need for Mental Models when working in specialized fields
4. Mental Models only work in technical domains while Domain Context applies to business problems
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    Mental Models are internal cognitive structures—frameworks and assumptions we use to understand how things work. Domain Context is the external body of knowledge, constraints, and conventions specific to a field. Both are essential to effective problem framing: Mental Models help us think systematically about complex systems, while Domain Context ensures our framing is grounded in the actual realities and knowledge of the field we're working in.

    **Concept:** Mental Model, Domain Context

---

#### 10. What is the relationship between using the Stranger Test and identifying Cognitive Bias in problem framing?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The Stranger Test is unrelated to cognitive bias; it only measures communication clarity
2. The Stranger Test helps expose cognitive biases by revealing assumptions that seem obvious to you but unclear to outsiders unfamiliar with your domain
3. Cognitive biases prevent the Stranger Test from working effectively
4. Only domain experts can reliably identify cognitive biases, so the Stranger Test is unhelpful
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**.

    The Stranger Test is particularly useful for surfacing cognitive biases because insiders (including you) often don't recognize their own biases—assumptions feel like facts when you're embedded in a domain. When a stranger questions your framing or finds it unclear, they're often uncovering hidden assumptions rooted in cognitive biases. Their external perspective helps make invisible biases visible, enabling you to examine and potentially reframe the problem more objectively.

    **Concept:** Stranger Test, Cognitive Bias
